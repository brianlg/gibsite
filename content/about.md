{{< figure src="img/bg.jpg" >}}

{{< lead >}}Hi, I'm Brian.{{< /lead >}} 

I'm a **Product Manager** living in Las Vegas, Nevada. My background is in Enterprise software. 

I joined **[Zappos.com](https://zappos.com)** in 2016 as a Business Analyst, and took an interest in process improvement. I  a project to automate Zappos' inventory sales-channel management process. This system is still in place and is used by roughly 100 internal users to this day. 

My focus on process improvements landed me in Product Management in 2017. As a PM, I have led projects across our internal reporting and analytics platform, as well as our pricing platform (pricing rules, calculation engines, and user-facing apps). I collaborate closely with Zappos internal stakeholders, Zappos engineering teams, as well as **Amazon** engineering teams. 

I received a bechelor's degree in 2011 from **Walsh University** after starting the first three years of my studies at **Bowling Green State University**. After graduating, and prior to joining Zappos, I worked as a Buyer at a local lumber company **Carter Lumber** and then as a Planning Analyst at **Dick's Sporting Goods**.
